# shared-metrics-NLP

This project was taken as part of the Text Mining course at NOVA IMS, the description was as following:

The conference on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) is a prestigious conference in the field of NLP and Machine Translations that builds on a series of annual workshops and conferences in Machine Translation, going back to 2006. This prestigious conference organizes a series of competitions in different aspects of machine translation. One of those competitions is the Metrics shared task whose goal is to create a metric that correlates with human assessments of quality.

Metrics shape the direction of research. They allow us to compare experiments, understand what our models are doing wrong, identify problems to work on, etc. 
With this said, a corpus will be released with translations for the following language pairs: 
- Russian into English
- German into English
- Czech into English
- Chinese into English - English into Chinese - English into Finish

For each translation you have the original segment, a reference translation (you gold truth) and quality assessment reflecting “how good is a translation” in a scale of 0 to 100, given by 1 or more human annotators. Those scores are then normalised to produce the z-score.
